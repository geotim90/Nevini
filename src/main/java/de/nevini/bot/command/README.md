# Command Package

The [*JDA-Utilities*](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) command package was not customizable enough to
implement the desired features. For this reason, a custom implementation of heavily inspired similar concepts can be
found in this package. Please note that the *JDA-Utilities* command package is incompatible with this implementation -
i.e. they are not interoperable - but can be used in parallel.
